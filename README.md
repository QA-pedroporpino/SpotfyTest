# Behind the Test – Episode 1: Spotify

## **Testing Like a Real User (No Login)**

Welcome to **Behind the Test**, a video series where we dive deep into professional QA automation, showcasing how to think strategically about testing and build robust, real-world test suites that go way beyond basic click-and-assert approaches.

I'm **Pedro Porpino**, and in this series, I'll walk you through the thought process of a senior QA engineer — from identifying critical user journeys to implementing intelligent fallback strategies that make tests resilient and maintainable.

**Episode 1** focuses on one of the most common scenarios in modern web applications: **the unauthenticated user experience**. We're testing Spotify Web's complete flow for users who haven't logged in yet, validating everything from internationalization to authentication boundaries.

This isn't just a test — it's a demonstration of how professional QA engineers approach real-world testing challenges with strategic thinking and technical excellence.

## 🎯 **Episode Objective**

Validate the complete user journey of an **unauthenticated user** on Spotify Web, ensuring that:

- **Internationalization works seamlessly** across different languages
- **Content discovery flows** are accessible without authentication  
- **Authentication boundaries** are properly enforced with user-friendly UX
- **Critical business flows** remain consistent and robust
- **Real user behavior** is accurately simulated and validated

This episode demonstrates how to transform a simple user story into a comprehensive test suite that covers business logic, UX patterns, and technical implementation details.

## 📋 **What This Test Covers**

### **🌐 Language Switching & i18n Validation**
- Locates and interacts with language selection using `data-testid="language-selection-button"`
- Switches interface to Portuguese (Brazil) via `data-testid="language-option-pt-BR"`
- Validates that UI elements reflect the language change in real-time

### **🔍 Content Discovery Flow**
- Performs artist search for "Pink Floyd" using `data-testid="search-input"`
- Navigates through search results using intelligent element location strategies
- Accesses "The Dark Side of the Moon" album through multiple selector fallback approaches

### **🎵 Authentication Boundary Testing**
- Attempts to play music using context-aware play button detection
- Validates that authentication modal appears for unauthenticated users
- Confirms modal content displays in the correct language: *"Escute com uma conta gratuita do Spotify"*

### **🛡️ System Consistency Validation**
- Ensures UI state remains consistent after modal interactions
- Verifies navigation flows work properly across language changes
- Documents the complete journey with strategic screenshot evidence

## 🛠️ **Technologies & Best Practices**

### **Core Stack**
- **[Playwright](https://playwright.dev/)** - Modern E2E testing framework
- **[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)** - Type-safe test development
- **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)** - Runtime environment

### **QA Engineering Excellence**
- **🎯 Test Steps**: Logical separation using `test.step()` for clear reporting
- **🔄 Intelligent Fallbacks**: Multiple selector strategies for robust element location
- **⚡ Performance Optimization**: Smart waiting strategies eliminating unnecessary `waitForTimeout()`
- **📸 Evidence Collection**: Strategic screenshots at critical validation points
- **🏗️ Maintainable Architecture**: Modular helpers for code reusability
- **🌍 Real-World Scenarios**: Tests mirror actual user behavior patterns

### **Advanced Strategies Showcased**
- **Context-aware element location** for ambiguous selectors
- **Multi-language validation** ensuring i18n functionality
- **Authentication boundary testing** for security and UX validation
- **Cascading selector fallback** for resilient test execution
